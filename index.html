            <p>Apathy is when you lack motivation to do anything or just don't care about what's going on around you.
                Apathy
                can
                be a symptom of mental health problems, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease. It often lasts a
                long
                time.
                You may lack the desire to do anything that involves thinking or your emotions.</p>
